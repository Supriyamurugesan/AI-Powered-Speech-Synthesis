# 🗣️ TypeTalk - Text to Speech Conversion using Tacotron2 and HiFi-GAN

**TypeTalk** is a deep learning-based Text-to-Speech (TTS) system built using NVIDIA’s Tacotron2 and HiFi-GAN models. This project takes English text input, generates a mel spectrogram using Tacotron2, and converts it into realistic speech audio using HiFi-GAN.
